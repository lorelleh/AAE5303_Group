# Group Information

## Group Name
**Aviation Mujica(Avi Mujica)**

## Why This Name?
Aviation Mujica (Avi Mujica) was chosen to represent our group's technical focus and engineering philosophy in the context of robust SLAM for low-altitude aerial vehicles.

The term "Aviation" explicitly reflects the application domain of our work, emphasizing aerial platforms operating in low-altitude, GPS-denied, and disturbance-prone environments. These conditions pose significant challenges to state estimation, localization, and mapping, making robustness a central requirement of the system design.

The name "Mujica" symbolically represents systems operating under severe internal uncertainty and external disturbances, while still maintaining stable and reliable outputs through robust control and SLAM techniques. In practical aerial SLAM scenarios, sensor noise, environmental dynamics, modeling errors, and nonlinearity introduce unavoidable instability and uncertainty within the system. However, through proper system modeling, estimation, and robust algorithm design, the overall closed-loop behavior remains controlled and dependable.

Together, Aviation Mujica embodies our core objective: designing SLAM systems that remain stable, consistent, and reliable for low-altitude aerial vehicles, even when operating under highly uncertain and challenging conditions.

## Slogan

Emotions may be unstable, but the system remains under control.
